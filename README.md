**CloudVault** is a high-performance **Storage Gateway** that acts as an intelligent caching layer between users and **AWS** S3. It minimizes cloud egress costs and latency by implementing a **Write-Through Cache** and ****LRU** Eviction Policy**, backed by Redis and local NVMe storage.

It features an **Event-Driven Architecture** using **AWS** **SQS** to automatically invalidate stale cache when files are modified directly in the cloud.

## ✨ Key Features

- **⚡ Smart Caching:** Serves frequently accessed files from local disk (5ms latency) instead of fetching from S3 (200ms+ latency).
- **🔄 Dual-Stream Uploads:** Pipes data to S3 and Local Disk simultaneously using Node.js Streams for non-blocking I/O.
- **🧹 Automatic Eviction (**LRU**):** Monitors disk usage. When the cache fills up (e.g., >**100MB**), it automatically deletes the *Least Recently Used* files to make space.
- **📡 Event-Driven Invalidation:** Listens to **AWS** **SQS** queues. If a file is deleted/updated in the S3 Console, the system instantly removes the stale local copy.
- **🐳 Fully Dockerized:** One-click deployment for App, Postgres, and Redis using Docker Compose.

Upload: Drag & drop a file to test the dual-stream upload.

Download: Click a file to see *Cache Hit* speeds.

Test Invalidation: Delete a file in **AWS** S3 Console and watch it disappear from your local list.

🧪 Testing the System ## The Speed Test First Download (Cache Miss): Fetches from S3.

Log: ☁️ **CACHE** **MISS**: Fetching from S3...

Second Download (Cache Hit): Serves from Disk.

Log: 🚀 **CACHE** **HIT**: Serving from NVMe/Disk

## The Eviction Test

Set MAX_CACHE_SIZE in src/services/evictionService.js to **10MB**.

Upload three **5MB** files.

Observe that the first file is automatically deleted from uploads/ to make room for the third.

🔮 Future Improvements **CDN** Integration: Place CloudFront in front of the gateway for global edge caching.

Request Coalescing: If **100** users request the same *Cache Miss* file simultaneously, download it once and stream to all.

Sharded Caching: Distribute cache across multiple Docker containers using Consistent Hashing. The system operates as a Hybrid Gateway linking your local computer to the **AWS** Cloud.

- The Data Plane (File Movement)
Write-Through Stream: When you upload, data is split into two streams:

Stream A: Writes to local src/uploads/ (Immediate access).

Stream B: Pipes directly to **AWS** S3 (Long-term backup).

Read-Through Cache: When you download:

Check Redis: *Do we have this file locally?*

Hit: Serve from src/uploads/ (5ms).

Miss: Download from S3 → Save to src/uploads/ → Serve to user.

- The Control Plane (Management)
Redis (The Index): Keeps a list of every file in the local cache, sorted by *Last Accessed Time.*

**LRU** Eviction Service: A background watcher. If src/uploads/ exceeds **100MB**, it asks Redis: *Who is the least popular file?* and deletes it to make room.

**SQS** Listener (The Ear): A background worker in server.js. It constantly listens to **AWS**. If you delete a file in the S3 Console, **SQS** shouts *Invalidate!*, and the worker deletes the local copy.

Non-Blocking I/O: Using streams instead of fs.readFile means you can upload a **10GB** video with only **50MB** of **RAM**.

Event-Driven Consistency: Using **SQS** means your local cache is never *stale* (outdated).

Infrastructure as Code: The entire environment (Database, Cache, App) spins up with one command: docker-compose up.
